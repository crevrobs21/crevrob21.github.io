Welcome to my site detailing my research with Professor Liu. During my first week of the research experience I was tasked with readings that went over phylogentics and gene sequencing techniques. Being that I do not have an extensive experience in biology, there were a lot of points of learning for me. Some of the more important models that I learned about were the Cavender-Ferris-Neyman Model which is a phylogentic estimation model often abbreviated CFN. I also read immensly about the many statistical distribution types used to analyze trees. I spoke alot with one of my lab mentors about which she used most often within her research and she mentioned Maximum Parsimony which is a phylogen estimnation method used in practice. Much of the material relating to trees felt oddly familiar just due to my coursework in Discrette Mathematics and Data Structures thus, it was was interesting to learn more about them within the evolutionary biology world.
