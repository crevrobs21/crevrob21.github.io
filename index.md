## About Me

My name is Christian and I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate student at Columbia University. 

## About My Mentor

Professor Kevin J Liu currently teaches at Michigan State University where he leads a Compuational Biology Lab. Hus lab creates new computational methodologies for efficient and accurate comparative genomic analyses – especially in the context of complex evolutionary scenarios – and then connects the resulting insights to phenotype and function. The end goal of their big-data-driven approach is to generate hypotheses that result in new biological and biomedical discoveries.

## About My Project

Throughout my research I have been working with new OS as well as phylogenetic sequencing models.
