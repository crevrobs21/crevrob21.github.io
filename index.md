## About Me

My name is Christian and I'm from Michigan. I am currently a rising senior Computer Science undergraduate student at Columbia University. I enjoy studying the ways that computer science methodologies can be used within other disciplines. I embarked on this research experience with little to no expectations but it allowed me to learn alot about myself and how I handle challanges. 

## About My Mentor

Professor Kevin J. Liu currently teaches at Michigan State University where he leads a Computational Biology Lab. His lab creates new computational methodologies for efficient and accurate comparative genomic analyses – especially in the context of complex evolutionary scenarios – and then connects the resulting insights to phenotype and function. The end goal of their big-data-driven approach is to generate hypotheses that result in new biological and biomedical discoveries.

## About My Project

Throughout my research I have been working with new OS as well as phylogenetic sequencing models. Most of my research was developed ad-hoc as I struggled to acquiant myself with other Operating Systems and software that was not adaptable on 64-bit newer mac OS.

## My Blog

Week One: Welcome to my site detailing my research with Professor Liu. During my first week of the research experience I was tasked with readings that went over phylogentics and gene sequencing techniques. Being that I do not have an extensive experience in biology, there were a lot of points of learning for me. Some of the more important models that I learned about were the Cavender-Ferris-Neyman Model which is a phylogentic estimation model often abbreviated CFN. I also read  about the many statistical distribution types used to analyze evolutionary trees. I spoke alot with one of my lab mentors about which she used most often within her research and she mentioned Maximum Parsimony which is a phylogenetic estimnation method used in practice. Much of the material relating to trees felt oddly familiar just due to my coursework in Discrette Mathematics and Data Structures thus, it was was interesting to learn more about them within the evolutionary biology world. The reading were largely out of textbooks of which my PhD mentor she breifly referenced throughout her research. I was comforted to know that all of what I was learning was not intuituive for the PhD students as well and that they often had to cross reference the very same textbooks and chapters. 

Week Two: As the reading were quite long I took this week to meet with this mentor about my progress thus far as I had not finished the roughlt three hundred pages of introductory information. She suggested I think less about the details of the textbook and think more about the bigger picture. Professor Liu had also given me the same advice. They both pushed the idea of understanding larger concepts from the textbook and using it as a starting point only. I continued to read from Inferring Phylogenies by Felsenstein who wrote about the Fitch and the Sankoff algorithms which are both methods to count evolutionary changes. Further, I read about the statistical properties of parsimony which I cannot say I truly understood. Again, my mentor and research advisor told me that it was not important to understand the intricacies of the properties and methods abut to think more about why it was important to conduct this typoe of analysis. 

Week Three: My research mentor mentioned to me that there was another student completing the DREU research experience although she was starting a bit later than myself. I definately was interested in being connected with her as well as the other undergraduate researches in the lab for the summer. Dr. Liu did the honor of emailing us all to introduce us which was amazing. I went ahead and scheduled some time to chat with the undergraduate researches within the lab as well as some individuals who were previously a part of the lab. I was very happy that Dr. Liu was able to connect us. All of the individuals I spoke to gave raving reviews about their time working under Dr. Liu which was very encouraging for me. Furthermore, the other undergaduate researches I spoke to had no idea there were other individuals working under Dr. Liu for the summer so it was fun to offer myself up as a resource. Toward the end of this week I informed my PhD mentor as well as Dr. Liu that I had finished my readings thus I was ready to ginto the more interactive portion of the summer - tutorial experiements. 

Week Four: Dr.Liu sent me a detailed list of experiments to conduct as my first research. I began this feat by attempting to download INDELible which is one of the most often used software within the lab - it generates phylogentic trees/AGTC sequences. Much to my surprise, when I tried to compile the software within terminal I ran into various errors that I had never encountered before. I did not have much experience with command line compilation but in some of my more recent classes I was tasked with using Linux commands and it felt like familiar territory for me. Further, I was unable to successfully compile the software through my Mac terminal, after attmepting for 2-3 days. I emailed both my PhD mentor and Dr. Liu to inquire about possible solutions. initially, Dr. Liu susggested that I try native C compilation through Xcode but myself nor my mentor was familiar with this method. My PhD mentor responedd by suggesting that I play with VirtualBoax - virtualization software. I had no experience with applkications like this so I was initally hesitant but I went ahead and tried the software steps/tutorial software she sent me. She warned me that this may be a long shot but this was all she could find as she was not a Mac user, neither was Dr Liu. I tried to download the virtulaization software which required that I donwload a much earlier version of Mac OS. 

Week Five: I tried to make the virtualization software work with two older versions of Mac OS both of which supported 32-bot applications. I soon figured out that the reason that the software was not working was because my newer Mac OS did not support 32-bit applications. Further, neither of the Mac OS were accessible by VritualBox after I downloaded both of them my Mac returned the error message that my stsem was too new to even open the packages. Additionally, when I downloaded the software fromt he App Store it was set up so that I only had access to the installer once the donwload was complete thus the virtulization software was unable to use that OS. I ended up meeting with Dr. Liu to discuss all of these challanges and he again suggested I try the compilation through XCode which I did end up doing. I was not super familiar with XCode compilaiton but I soon reaalized it was wildly similar to command line when using C. I only started to run into challanges when I used that the version of C used in the indelible software was much older than that supported by Xcode.
