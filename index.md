## About Me

My name is Christian and I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate student at Columbia University. 

## About My Mentor

Professor Kevin J Liu currently teaches at Michigan State University where he leads a Compuational Biology Lab. His lab creates new computational methodologies for efficient and accurate comparative genomic analyses – especially in the context of complex evolutionary scenarios – and then connects the resulting insights to phenotype and function. The end goal of their big-data-driven approach is to generate hypotheses that result in new biological and biomedical discoveries.

## About My Project

Throughout my research I have been working with new OS as well as phylogenetic sequencing models.

Week One: Welcome to my site detailing my research with Professor Liu. During my first week of the research experience I was tasked with readings that went over phylogentics and gene sequencing techniques. Being that I do not have an extensive experience in biology, there were a lot of points of learning for me. Some of the more important models that I learned about were the Cavender-Ferris-Neyman Model which is a phylogentic estimation model often abbreviated CFN. I also read immensly about the many statistical distribution types used to analyze trees. I spoke alot with one of my lab mentors about which she used most often within her research and she mentioned Maximum Parsimony which is a phylogen estimnation method used in practice. Much of the material relating to trees felt oddly familiar just due to my coursework in Discrette Mathematics and Data Structures thus, it was was interesting to learn more about them within the evolutionary biology world.
